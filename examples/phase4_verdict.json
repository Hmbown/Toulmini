    "status": "remanded",
    "reasoning": "The argument chain presents a coherent case grounded in Terror Management Theory, existentialist philosophy, and the hedonic treadmill phenomenon. However, the strong rebuttals expose a fundamental limitation: all evidence derives from mortal psychology extrapolated to an unprecedented condition. The category error objection (arguing from mortal to immortal psychology) and the existence of alternative meaning frameworks (contemplative traditions, intrinsically rewarding activities) create sufficient doubt. With qualifier confidence at 45% and rebuttal strength rated strong, the claim cannot be sustained but is not definitively overruled—the question requires empirical data that cannot exist.",
    "final_statement": "The claim that immortality constitutes a curse remains philosophically contested; insufficient empirical grounding to render definitive judgment"
